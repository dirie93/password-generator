# Password Generator Starter Code

In this project, I used the starter code to adapt the code and add some JavaScript functionality, whereby the user is able to generate a randomised password through the use of certain criterias. 

## User-Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

```
