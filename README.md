# Password Generator Starter Code

In this project, I used the starter code to adapt the code and add some JavaScript functionality, whereby the user is able to generate a randomised password through the use of certain criterias. 

## User-Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

```

## Application

[Deployed App:](https://www.google.co.uk/)

## Reflection 

 * I developed a better understanding of initialising variables and declaring them.
 
 * I was able to get a better insight into concatenating arrays and how it is useful in code.

 * Better understanding of the for-loop and iterating through the array to reach certain conditions etc.
